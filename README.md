# ACKNOWLEDGEMENT
This project is prepared with the assistance of the course **[SQL for Data Analysis: Advanced SQL Querying Techniques](https://www.udemy.com/course/sql-advanced-queries)** on Udemy.

# PROJECT OVERVIEW
Working with a comprehensive historical dataset of Major League Baseball (MLB) players, including statistics such as schools attended, salaries, teams played for, height, weight, and more. The project focuses on leveraging advanced SQL querying techniques to analyze how player statistics have evolved over time and across different teams in the league. 
# üéØ **PROJECT OBJECTIVES**  

This project aims to explore historical MLB player data using advanced SQL queries to answer key questions:  

1. üè´ **Player Education:** Identify the schools attended by MLB players.  
2. üí∞ **Team Expenditures:** Analyze how much teams spend on player salaries over the years.  
3. üèÜ **Career Progression:** Examine the career timelines of players, from debut to final game.  
4. ‚öñÔ∏è **Player Comparison:** Compare player attributes such as height, weight, batting, and throwing preferences.  

# DATA SOURCES

There are 4 tables :- players , salaries , school_details ,schools 
- **`players`**: Player biographical and career details.  
  - **PK:** `playerID`  
  - **Key Fields:** Birth/death info, name, weight, height, batting/throwing hand, debut/final game dates, external IDs.  

- **`salaries`**: Annual salary data for players.

### üìä DATA ANALYSIS
This project involves analyzing historical MLB player data using advanced SQL queries, structured into four main parts: School Analysis, Salary Analysis, Player Career Analysis, and Player Comparison Analysis. Each section addresses specific questions to derive meaningful insights.

##  PART I: SCHOOL ANALYSIS
Focuses on understanding the educational backgrounds of MLB players.

**üîé Steps:**
**1.Explore School Data: Review the schools and school_details tables.**
 ```sql 
 SELECT * FROM schools;
SELECT * FROM school_details;
```
**2.Decade-wise School Count: Determine how many schools produced players in each decade.**
 ```sql
SELECT 	FLOOR(yearID / 10) * 10 AS decade, COUNT(DISTINCT schoolID) AS num_schools
FROM	schools
GROUP BY decade
ORDER BY decade;
```
Result :-

**3.Top Schools Overall: Identify the top 5 schools that produced the most players.**
 ```sql
SELECT	 sd.name_full, COUNT(DISTINCT s.playerID) AS num_players
FROM	 schools s LEFT JOIN school_details sd
		 ON s.schoolID = sd.schoolID
GROUP BY s.schoolID
ORDER BY num_players DESC
LIMIT 	 5;
```

Result :-

**4.Top Schools by Decade: For each decade, list the top 3 schools with the highest number of player alumni.**
 ```sql
WITH ds AS (SELECT	 FLOOR(s.yearID / 10) * 10 AS decade, sd.name_full, COUNT(DISTINCT s.playerID) AS num_players
			FROM	 schools s LEFT JOIN school_details sd
					 ON s.schoolID = sd.schoolID
			GROUP BY decade, s.schoolID),
            
	 rn AS (SELECT	decade, name_full, num_players,
					ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY decade ORDER BY num_players DESC) AS row_num
                    /* ALTERNATIVE SOLUTION UPDATE: ROW_NUMBER will return exactly 3 schools for each decade. To account for ties,
                       use DENSE_RANK instead to return the top 3 player counts, which could potentially include more than 3 schools */
			FROM	ds)
            
SELECT	decade, name_full, num_players
FROM	rn
WHERE	row_num <= 3
ORDER BY decade DESC, row_num;
```

FROM	sp
WHERE	spend_pct = 1;
```

```sql
SELECT 	nameGiven,
        TIMESTAMPDIFF(YEAR, CAST(CONCAT(birthYear, '-', birthMonth, '-', birthDay) AS DATE), debut)
			AS starting_age,
		TIMESTAMPDIFF(YEAR, CAST(CONCAT(birthYear, '-', birthMonth, '-', birthDay) AS DATE), finalGame)
			AS ending_age,
		TIMESTAMPDIFF(YEAR, debut, finalGame) AS career_length
FROM	players
ORDER BY career_length DESC;
```

           FROM salaries s LEFT JOIN players p
           ON s.playerID = p.playerID) -- unique players CTE

SELECT teamID,
		ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN bats = 'R' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(playerID) * 100, 1) AS bats_right,
        ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN bats = 'L' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(playerID) * 100, 1) AS bats_left,
        ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN bats = 'B' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(playerID) * 100, 1) AS bats_both
